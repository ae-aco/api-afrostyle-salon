### Afro Salon API Project

### Mock Scenario
In this mock scenario, I have designed and implemented a **afrocentric salon reservation system** using express.js in node.js. This API allows clients to book either a hairdressing appointment (wash, blow-dry, braids etc.). Clients can create an account, view appointment availability - based on the stylists availability, as well as book, modify and cancel an appointment.
